                I started my journey in the world of computers from a young age. Now I’m 22 years old, pursuing my Software Engineering degree at DTU. Deep Learning is my center of interest; I always love the idea of cross-platform development—one codebase deployed into almost any platform, which web technology like JavaScript enables me to do. I also like creating interactive UI components for better UX and sharing those designs and codes with the world through GitHub, CodePen, and Instagram.
